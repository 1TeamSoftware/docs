# Overview

Large media libraries slow your server down, drive up hosting costs, and make pages load slower for visitors. The bigger your library gets, the worse it gets.

## What Does It Do?

**WP CloudSync Master moves your WordPress media files off your web server and onto cloud storage.** Instead of serving images and videos from your local server, the plugin uploads them to platforms like Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, or Google Cloud. When a visitor loads a page, the media is served directly from the cloud, typically through a CDN.

### The core benefits

*   **Faster page loads:** CDNs serve static files from edge locations close to your visitors, which means shorter load times.
*   **Lower hosting costs:** Move storage and bandwidth off your web host. Providers like Cloudflare R2 charge zero egress fees.
*   **Better SEO:** Faster pages rank better. Cloud offloading directly improves Core Web Vitals scores.
*   **No disk space limits:** Cloud storage scales with your library. You stop worrying about running out of space on your server.

## Free vs. PRO

**The Free version** gives you everything you need to offload new media to any of our 10 supported cloud providers, including background sync and URL rewriting.

**CloudSync Master PRO** adds tools for businesses and power users:
*   **The Media Scanner:** Bulk-upload your *existing* media library to the cloud.
